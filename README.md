# atom-import-cost

&nbsp;

ðŸš§ Work in progress! ðŸš§

&nbsp;

#### TODO:

Please feel free to help me with any of them ðŸ™ˆ

- fix the label position

  Right now, the label comes on the wrong line. Haven't been able to figure out why.

- automatically activate on startup

  Haven't properly RTFM yet

- use persistent cache

  Right now, sizes are stored in a session cache, making it persistant would be a useful optimisation.

Check back in a few days or follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/siddharthkp) to know when it's done.
